# HTML5 File Metadata

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/abdulhannanali/html5-file-metadata.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a small program I made as a task in Google CodeIN with [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org). This reads the file meta data for the files you select and show them to you in an organized tabular way.
